# üìÑ **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**

**Project Title:** *Worldforge Realms*
**Prepared For:** Game development team (or solo developer)
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** July 18, 2025

## üîñ 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

To define the requirements for **Worldforge Realms**, a browser-based 3D voxel adventure game with AI-driven world interaction, multiplayer mechanics, city-building, and monetization features.

### 1.2 Scope

The game will be:

* Built using **Three.js** for 3D rendering.
* Playable on **mobile, desktop, and laptops** via HTML5.
* Focused on **revenue generation** through ads and IAPs.
* Driven by a unique storyline: **permadeath**, **AI world guide**, and **dynamic world laws**.
* Multiplayer-enabled with real-time interaction, city building, PvE, PvP, and alliances.

## 1.3 World Description

**Worldforge Realms** is set in a vast, ancient, voxel-style 3D world governed by mystical laws and AI-driven dynamics. The realm is procedurally generated into **biomes** such as enchanted forests, frozen tundras, scorched deserts, corrupted lands, and ancient ruins.

The world is not static‚Äîit evolves based on player activity and guidance from a mysterious AI presence called **"The Architect"**. Every player‚Äôs action leaves an imprint on the world, potentially altering future quests, unlocking events, or triggering server-wide changes.

Key World Features:

* üåê **Dynamic Regions**: New zones appear over time or through specific conditions (e.g., unlocking dungeons, completing rituals).
* üèïÔ∏è **Player-Claimed Land**: Each player can claim and build within an area. Claimed lands can grow into cities or be contested in wars.
* üß≠ **Lore-Driven Landmarks**: Players can discover temples, fallen civilizations, or ancient vaults connected to a hidden narrative.
* ‚öñÔ∏è **World Laws**: Rules of nature (e.g., death permanence, resurrection conditions, resource behavior) change slightly over time based on global actions.
* üëÅÔ∏è **AI-Controlled Events**: Periodic changes like storms, monster invasions, or resource scarcity are introduced by The Architect to keep gameplay engaging and unpredictable.
